If you know these basic commands, you can start using a linux server. Its very easy!

See file contents:
cat filename: reads file sequentially and writes it to standard output
tail -f filename : this shows you the last few modifications to the file and updates it realtime
tail -100 filename: shows the last 100 lines of a file. Replace 100 with any number

See file names in directory:
ls : list all files in directory
ls -lt: list all files in directory in descending order of last modified date

Write to files:
sudo nano filename: opens file in nano editor with admin priveleges

Remove file:
sudo rm filename: removes file from directory with admin priveleges

Git commands:
git pull
git checkout branchname: checks out specified branch
git checkout -- filename: discards changes and resets file to branch version
git add filename: adds file to staging
git status: shows current status of files added, modified or deleted. 

Environment commands:
Ctl+Z: stop or cancel a command
ps -p <PID>: If the process is alive then, this will return the process id with the time and command.
sudo screen -m -L -d python3 pythonfile.py : creates a background process pythonfile.py and creates a log for it in screenlog.0 in same folder

Tips:
Tab: after typing a few characters of filename if you click on Tab key, linux will complete the file name for you if it can uniquely identify the file
WinSCP: Can be used to transfer files between local windows computer and remote server
